# Dungeon Map

![build](https://github.com/stevecochrane/dungeon-map/workflows/build/badge.svg)

This will hopefully, eventually be a web application for mapping out old
videogames, as you would back in the day with Metroid, Phantasy Star, etc. but
for now it's very much a work in progress. I'm mainly doing this as an excuse
to get more practice with React and Redux, but if this is useful/fun for
anyone, even better.

This is inspired by Jeremy Parish's
[Cart-ography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIUhIfD_bNQ&list=PLd3vJYdenHKH6_-QX1_mJX0WLlw6VeTEe)
series on YouTube, where he live-streams drawing out maps of games on graph paper
while playing them.

Here's how to get it running:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Lint test CSS
npm run lint:css

# Lint test JavaScript
npm run lint:js

# Run in development mode
npm run start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run in production mode
npm run server
```
